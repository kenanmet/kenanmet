### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ±I'm Kenan Met. I studied mechanical engineering at Nigde Ã–mer Halisdemir University. I graduated in 2020.
I'm currently working on developing myself in the field of test automation. I'm open to learning and closely following new technologies.

Since I began in software development, I have learned a lot, but there are still many things that I don't know. 
Researching and learning about topics I am not familiar with, and continuing to improve myself in this field is my current greatest pleasure.
